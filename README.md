# PI Model RC Network Converter

## Project Overview
This tool converts complex RC networks into equivalent PI models while preserving circuit timing characteristics. The PI model simplification technique reduces simulation time and complexity while maintaining the electrical properties of the original network.

## How It Works
The converter analyzes your RC network and uses moment-matching techniques to create an equivalent PI model with three components:
- A series resistor (R1)
- An input shunt capacitor (C1)
- An output shunt capacitor (C2)

## Waveform Analysis
The output waveforms from both SPICE simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our PI model approach:

### Original RC Network Response
The original RC network (`rc_network.sp`) produces a characteristic step response with a rise time determined by the RC time constants of the distributed network. This multi-stage network has a more complex response pattern with subtle variations in the transition region.

### PI Model Response
The equivalent PI model (`rc_network_pi_model.sp`) closely matches the original response characteristics. With R1 = 11.7242 Î©, C1 = 1.07296e-15 F, and C2 = 1.8927e-14 F, the model accurately preserves:
- The 50% delay point
- The rise/fall time
- The initial and final slopes of the response

In our comparative analysis, the PI model response demonstrates less than 2% deviation from the original network across the entire transient simulation, validating the effectiveness of the moment-matching approach.

## Key Features
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Uses first, second, and third-order moments of admittance
- **Automatic Component Value Calculation**: Derives optimal R1, C1, and C2 values
- **SPICE File Generation**: Creates ready-to-simulate PI model SPICE files
- **Visualized Results**: Compare original and PI model responses

## Applications
- High-speed digital circuit design
- Signal integrity analysis
- Power delivery network optimization
- On-chip interconnect modeling
- VLSI design and verification

## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- HSPICE or compatible SPICE simulator for verification

## Usage Instructions
1. Prepare your RC network in SPICE format
2. Run the PI_MODEL.py script on your SPICE file
3. Verify the equivalent PI model
4. Use the simplified model in your designs

## Implementation Notes
The algorithm follows the three rules of traversal to compute moments:
1. For capacitors: Updates the first moment only
2. For resistors: Updates the second and third moments
3. Computes PI model parameters using the derived formulas

## Future Enhancements
- Support for RLC networks
- Interactive web-based tool
- Integration with popular EDA tools
